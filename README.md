# IoT-Honeypot-Sandbox-Implementation
A complete toolkit for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing IoT malware using TPOT, static/dynamic analysis and web-based dashboards.

## Features

* üì• **Malware Capture Dashboard**: Visual interface to track and manage captured IoT malware from TPOT based IoT specific honeypots automatically in real time.
* üß™ **Static Analysis**: Bash + Python scripts for ELF analysis, UPX detection/unpacking, string extraction, and IP/URL detection.
* üêö **Dynamic Analysis**: Architecture-specific QEMU Docker environments to execute malware and collect system calls and network PCAPs with the help of https://github.com/alrawi/badthings-tools/tree/master/dynamic_analysis.
* üìä **Dashboards**: Lightweight HTML+JS dashboards to visualize both static and dynamic analysis reports.

## Tech Stack

* Bash, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
* QEMU, Docker (multi-arch images from `badthings-tools`)
* Tools: `binwalk`, `upx`, `readelf`, `7z`, `unzip`, `strace`, `tcpdump`

## Getting Started

### Malware Capture Dashboard
To identify and access the details of the captured malware from TPOT automatically and live, follow these steps:
1. In the machine where TPOT is deployed, clone the repo and `cd` to `malware_capture_dashboard/` directory
2. Follow the README.md present in that directory

### Automated Static Analysis
1. Clone the repo and set up dependencies (`binwalk`, `upx`, etc.).
2. Use the capture dashboard to track/download malware.
3. Run `iot_static_analysis_json_upx.sh` on samples.
4. Use `iot_static_analysis.html` to view static reports.
5. Execute architecture-matching Docker container for dynamic analysis.
6. View `strace` and `pcap` insights using dynamic analysis dashboard.
